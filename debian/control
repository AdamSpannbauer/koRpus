Description: GNU R package: A set of tools to analyze texts. Includes, amongst others, functions for automatic language detection,
 hyphenation, several indices of lexical diversity (e.g., type token ratio, HD-D/vocd-D, MTLD) and readability (e.g., Flesch, SMOG,
 LIX, Dale-Chall). Basic import functions for language corpora are also provided, to enable frequency analyses (supports Celex and
 Leipzig Corpora Collection file formats) and measures like tf-idf. Support for additional languages can be added on-the-fly or by
 plugin packages. Note: For full functionality a local installation of TreeTagger is recommended. 'koRpus' also includes a plugin for
 the R GUI and IDE RKWard, providing graphical dialogs for its basic features. The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed
 directly from a repository, as it is a part of RKWard. To make full use of this feature, please install RKWard from
 https://rkward.kde.org (plugins are detected automatically). Due to some restrictions on CRAN, the full package sources are only
 available from the project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, suggest feature improvements, or discuss the global development of
 the package, please subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list (https://ml06.ispgateway.de/mailman/ listinfo/korpus-dev_r.reaktanz.de).
